# **Momentary Push Buttons to Switches** Library (mpbToSwitch)
## An STM32 RTOS library that builds switch mechanisms replacements out of simple push buttons.  
By using just a push button (a.k.a. momentary switches or momentary buttons) the classes implemented in this library will manage, calculate and update different parameters to **simulate the behavior of standard electromechanical switches**. Those parameters include presses, timings, counters or secondary inputs as needed.
